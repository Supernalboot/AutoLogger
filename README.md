# Sekure

## What is Sekure

Sekure is a Discord Chat Bot created using Node.js/Discord.js.

---

## What does it do

Sekure is a powerful, secure, moderation bot, with features including: Advanced Logging, Smart Anti-Spam and even Message Encryption!
(however time got to the best of us and Anti-Spam will be released after Hackweek)

---

## Can I use parts from the bot

YES, this bot is open sourced to everyone to use and learn from! If you feel like supporting the project we would love it if you could help spread it to many people and servers! ~~Or don't we don't mind~~.

---

## Will this bot be Updated after Discords Hack Week

YES IT MOST CERTAINLY WILL! We plan on adding many features after Discord Hack Week is done as we want to make a very simple and easy bot to use.

Things coming after Hackweek include:
- Auto Anti-Spam
- MORE logs
- Mod commands
and more!..

---

## How does it work

Sekure bot can be invited to your server (Invite code will be available after Hackweek) and then with a simple command you will automatically start logging everything in your server, which you can then toggle individually! Anti-spam features will be on automatically and act automatically providing moderators a chance to confirm any final actions, meaning when raids happen they are blocked instantly and give moderators an easy way to ban them all!
