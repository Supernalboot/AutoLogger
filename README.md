Sekure is a powerful Bot, allowing you to log many things that happen in a server and can be changed by enabling and disabling modules as well as selecting which channels to send what logs to.

## Can I use parts from the bot

YES, this bot is open sourced to everyone to use and learn from! If you feel like supporting the project we would love it if you could help spread it to many people and servers! ~~Or don't we don't mind~~.
